  <h2>About Afrin</h2>
  <p>If a girl ever had to write her own story, it would be filled with courage, strength, and the madness of chasing her dreams.  
  Afrin is the kind of name that means silence can also roar.  
  For her, life is about passion, dreams, and the power to rise after every fall.  
  No matter how hard things get, she believes strength grows from pain — and one day her name will shine where respect speaks first.  
  Behind every calm smile, there’s a fighter. Afrin is that fighter. 💫</p>

<section id="study">
  <h2>Study Journey</h2>
  <p>For Afrin, studying isn’t just about books — it’s her first weapon in the battle of life.  
  Science isn’t an easy road, but her determination is stronger than any difficulty.  
  Every page she studies is a step toward her destiny, every formula hides a dream.  
  Her notes whisper one line — “One day I’ll make it.”  
  Her NDA preparation isn’t just for an exam, it’s a fight to prove her worth.  
  She believes her uniform will one day be the symbol of pride, and every morning begins with that dream in her eyes.</p>

  <h2>Dream</h2>
  <p>Afrin’s dream isn’t just a career — it’s an identity.  
  That uniform represents honor, courage, and sacrifice.  
  Becoming an officer is not just her wish, it’s her promise to herself.  
  For Afrin, the uniform isn’t just fabric — it’s confidence woven with purpose.  
  And the day she wears it, the world will know what it means when a girl decides to win. 💥</p>
